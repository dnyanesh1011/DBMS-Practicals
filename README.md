## 📘 About This Repository

This repository contains all the **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** practical experiments conducted during the **Third Year (TE)** under the **Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU)** curriculum.

It covers both **SQL (MySQL / Oracle)** and **NoSQL (MongoDB)** concepts, including **PL/SQL**, **cursors**, **triggers**, and **connectivity with front-end languages**.

The repo serves as a **complete digital version of the DBMS Lab Manual**, with step-by-step practicals, SQL scripts, and MongoDB query examples.

## 🧾 Index of Practicals

| Sr. No. | Title | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **ER Model Design** | Create a conceptual design using ER tools (ERDPlus / ERWin). Convert the ER diagram into tables and normalize them. |
| 2 | **SQL – Basic DML & DDL Operations (Part 1)** | Write SQL queries using `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, with operators, functions, and constraints. |
| 3 | **SQL – Basic DML & DDL Operations (Part 2)** | Continuation of practical 2 with more examples of SQL objects like `VIEW`, `INDEX`, `SEQUENCE`, etc. |
| 4 | **SQL – Joins, Subqueries & Views (Part 1)** | Implement all types of joins and subqueries. Create and manage database views. |
| 5 | **SQL – Joins, Subqueries & Views (Part 2)** | Advanced practice on multi-level subqueries and nested joins. |
| 6 | **PL/SQL – Anonymous Block** | Write an unnamed PL/SQL block using control structures and exception handling. |
| 7 | **PL/SQL – Stored Procedures & Functions (Part 1)** | Create stored procedures and user-defined functions for database operations. |
| 8 | **PL/SQL – Stored Procedures & Functions (Part 2)** | More examples of named blocks, functions, and parameter passing. |
| 9 | **PL/SQL – Cursors (Part 1)** | Implement implicit and explicit cursors in PL/SQL. |
| 10 | **PL/SQL – Cursors (Part 2)** | Work with `FOR LOOP` and parameterized cursors. |
| 11 | **PL/SQL – Triggers (Part 1)** | Write triggers of types BEFORE/AFTER, ROW level, and STATEMENT level. |
| 12 | **PL/SQL – Triggers (Part 2)** | Practice on compound and multiple-event triggers. |
| 13 | **MySQL/Oracle – Database Connectivity** | Implement database connectivity using any front-end language (e.g., Python, Java, PHP) with CRUD operations. |
| 14 | **MongoDB – CRUD Operations** | Perform basic MongoDB operations like `insertOne()`, `find()`, `updateOne()`, and logical queries. |
| 15 | **MongoDB – Aggregation & Indexing** | Use aggregation pipelines and indexing in MongoDB. |
| 16 | **MongoDB – MapReduce** | Implement MapReduce operation with a suitable example. |
| 17 | **MongoDB – Database Connectivity** | Connect MongoDB with a front-end language to perform CRUD operations. |
